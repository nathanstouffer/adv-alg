Consider the following statement: If $a$ and $b$ are both even numbers, then $ab$ is
an even number.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the definition of an odd number?
    \item What is the definition of an even number?
    \item What is the contrapositive of this statement?
    \item What is the converse of this statement?
    \item Prove this statement.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Answer}

% ============================================

We now give answers to the above questions.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The following is the definition of an odd number.
    If an integer $n$ can be written as $ n = 2*k + 1 $ for some integer $k$, then $n$ is said to be odd.
    \item The following is the definition of an even number.
    If an integer $n$ can be written as $ n = 2*k$ for some integer $k$, then $n$ is said to be even.
    \item The contrapositive of ``If $a$ and $b$ are both even numbers, then $ab$ is an even number'' is ``If $ab$ is an odd number, then either $a$ or $b$ must be odd.''
    \item The converse of ``If $a$ and $b$ are both even numbers, then $ab$ is an even number'' is ``If $ab$ is an even number, then $a$ and $b$ are both even numbers.''
    \item We now prove the statement ``If $a$ and $b$ are both even numbers, then $ab$ is an even number.''
    We prove this directly.

    Since $a$ and $b$ are both even, there exist integers $k,j$ such that $a = 2k$ and $b = 2j$.
    By substitution, $ab = (2k) (2j) = 2(2kj) $.
    Let $n = 2kj$, we know that $n \in \Z$ by closure of integers with multiplication.
    We also know that $2n$ is even and that $2n = ab$.
    Since $2n$ is even, $ab$ must be even as well.
    So, we have shown that given two even numbers $a$ and $b$, their product $ab$ must also be even.
\end{enumerate}
